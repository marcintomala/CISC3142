### Name: Marcin Tomala

Computer Science & Computational Mathematics major at Brooklyn College. 

My career interests lie primarily in software development, though I am also interested in applying mathematics in computing.

As far as other information about me - I love cats and music! In my free time I enjoy reading (mostly history and philosophy) and video games. In the past year or so, I've also been learning to play the piano and Japanese.
